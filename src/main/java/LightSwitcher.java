/**
 * This lab is just a practice in bitwise operations.  Though all of the return and arg types are ints,

 * Use only bitwise operations (&, |, ^, ~, >>>, >>, <<) and return.  Nothing else.
 *
 * The tests are written for you, so look at those for inspiration on how to solve these.  All you need to do is write
 *     the functions to make the tests pass.
